                <div>This tool describes how a deliberate biological outbreak might unfold, including the stakeholders
                    who would be involved in identifying, responding to, and recovering from the event, and the policies
                    that govern these efforts. Policy documents are identified as they become relevant during a notional
                    event timeline, and those documents are linked to the stakeholders who draw their mandates from each
                    policy document. The functional roles for each stakeholder are also identified, including affected
                    and non-affected member States, UN and other international organizations, local and international
                    NGOs, and private sector organizations would play as the event progresses.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="graphic-title"><h4>Background</h4></div>
                <div>Despite global efforts to build national and international capacity to prevent, detect and respond
                    to biological threats, little effort or resources have been devoted to deliberate biological events
                    (DBE). Many standard practices and the stakeholders involved in outbreak response activities -
                    including clinical efforts, sample collection, and information sharing - may be hindered or altered
                    in a deliberate event. Indeed, many of the traditional stakeholders may have no plan or even
                    mandates to engage in a response, leaving the international community at significant risk of a slow
                    and ineffectively response strategy.<br> <br>

                    Beyond identifying stakeholders, it is still unclear how and from whom requests for assistance will
                    come during a deliberate event. Article VII of the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention commits
                    “each [State Party] to provide or support assistance, in accordance with the United Nations Charter,
                    to any Party to the Convention which so requests, if the Security Council decides that such Party
                    has been exposed to danger as a result of violation of the Convention”. More than 40 years since
                    entry into force of the BWC, concerns and uncertainties remain about the processes and feasibility
                    of providing assistance.<br> <br>

                    In September 2017, a gathering of international experts at Wilton Park identified the need to
                    identify and map stakeholders and clarify processes and pathways associated with BWC Article VII as
                    two key areas of work required to enhance international capacity to respond to deliberate biological
                    events. This tool provides interactive graphics to identify stakeholders, relevant policies, and
                    roles in a deliberate event scenario, each mapped to a time line of a notional biological outbreak
                    scenario affecting humans and suspected to be deliberate.<br> <br>

                    This research and subsequent interactive tool was funded by a grant to Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security from the Open Philanthropy Project.

This work was also informed by the BWC Article VII project, funded by the Government of Canada, and the contributions of participants from across the International Organizations at this project's workshops. <br> <br>
