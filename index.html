					<div>This tool describes how a deliberate biological outbreak might unfold, including the stakeholders who would be involved in identifying, responding to, and recovering from the event, and the policies that govern these efforts. Policy documents are identified as they become relevant during a notional event timeline, and those documents are linked to the stakeholders who draw their mandates from each policy document. The functional roles for each stakeholder are also identified, including affected and non-affected member States, UN and other international organizations, local and international NGOs, and private sector organizations would play as the event progresses.</div>

				<div>Each policy governs specific stakeholders, as shown. Hover over a policy document to highlight the related stakeholders; hover over a stakeholder to view a description of their role during an event. Policy documents, including constitutions, resolutions, conventions, memorandums of understanding, and mission statements, identify the triggers for stakeholder engagement. Each policy document characterizes stakeholder mandates during the event and are identified at the point at which it first applies or becomes applicable. In some cases, single policy documents may apply throughout the event.</div>

					<div class="graphic-title"><h1>Background</h1></div>
					<div>Despite global efforts to build national and international capacity to prevent, detect and respond to biological threats, little effort or resources have been devoted to deliberate biological events (DBE).  Many standard practices and the stakeholders involved in outbreak response activities - including clinical efforts, sample collection, and information sharing -  may be hindered or altered in a deliberate event.  Indeed, many of the traditional stakeholders may have no plan or even mandates to engage in a response, leaving the international community at significant risk of a slow and ineffectively response strategy. <br> <br>

					Beyond identifying stakeholders, it is still unclear how and from whom requests for assistance will come during a deliberate event.   Article VII of the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention commits “each [State Party] to provide or support assistance, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, to any Party to the Convention which so requests, if the Security Council decides that such Party has been exposed to danger as a result of violation of the Convention” [BWC 1972]. More than 40 years since entry into force of the BWC, concerns and uncertainties remain about the processes and feasibility of providing assistance. <br> <br>

					In September 2017, a gathering of international experts at Wilton Park identified the need to identify and map stakeholders and clarify processes and pathways associated with BWC Article VII as two key areas of work required to enhance international capacity to respond to deliberate biological events.  [Wilton Park 2017]. This tool provides interactive graphics to identify stakeholders, relevant policies, and roles in a deliberate event scenario, each mapped to a time line of a notional biological outbreak scenario affecting humans and suspected to be deliberate.</div>
