					<div> This tool describes how a deliberate zoonotic outbreak might unfold, including the stakeholders who would be involved in identifying, responding to, and recovering from the event, and the policies that govern these efforts. We identify policy documents as they become relevant during a notional event timeline, and link those documents to the stakeholders who draw their mandates from each policy document. We also identify the functional roles that stakeholders, including affected and non-affected national governments, UN organizations, NGOs, and private sector organizations would play as the event progresses. </div>

					<div class="graphic-title"><h3>Deliberate Biological Event Timeline</h3></div>
					<div>As a deliberate biological event unfolds, the stakeholders involved in identifying, responding to, and recovering from an event change over time, based on a series of policy documents that govern each stakeholder's role during the event. Each event shown in the timeline below identifies a point during which a new set of policy documents become applicable. Click on a timeline event in the timeline below to explore the policies that apply during during the selected period of the outbreak, the stakeholders to whom those policies apply, and the roles each stakeholder would play based on their mandates. </div>

				<div class="graphic-title"><h3>Policy Documents and Stakeholders</h3></div>
				<div> Policy documents, including constitutions, resolutions, conventions, memorandums of understanding, and mission statements, identify the triggers which prompt stakeholders to become involved in a deliberate biological event. These policy documents also characterize the mandates of each stakeholder during event identification, response, and recovery. Hover over a policy document to highlight the stakeholders to whom the document applies, or hover over a stakeholder to view a description of the stakeholder's overall role during a deliberate biological event. Policy documents are identified at the point in the event timeline during which they first apply, though a single policy document may apply throughout the entire timeline of a deliberate biological event.</div>

				<div class="graphic-title"><h3>Stakeholder Roles</h3></div>
				<div>At each point in the timeline of a deliberate biological event, various stakeholders are involved in a set of functional roles supporting response efforts, including providing public health and medical care, humanitarian aid, safety and security, or policy and governance. Categories of stakeholders include affected and non-affected national governments, UN organizations, NGOs, and private sector organizations. Click on a stakeholder category (e.g. UN organizations) to view the roles of individuals stakeholders within that group. Click on a functional role (e.g. public health and medical) to view the individual stakeholders responsible with mandates related to that role.</div>

					<div> The deliberate biological event stakeholder tool describes how a deliberate zoonotic outbreak might unfold, including the stakeholders who would be involved in identifying, responding to, and recovering from the event, and the policies that govern these efforts. The tool was developed based on a data framework that identifies the stakeholders expected to be involved in a deliberate biological event, the policy documents that identify each stakeholder's mandates and triggers, and the functional role(s) of each stakeholder during the event. These data were aligned with a notional event timeline to identify the ways in which relevant policy documents, the stakeholders who would be involved, and the roles of those stakeholders would change as the event progresses. </div>
